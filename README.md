CSS Compiler / Obfuscator / Minifier / Transpiler
==================================================================

> PHP 5.3.0 or >

Stylesheet Compiler makes it possible to rename CSS class names 
in your stylesheet, which helps reduce the size of the CSS that 
is sent down to your users.
Of course, this is not particularly useful unless the class names 
are renamed consistently in the HTML and CSS files that use the names.
Fortunately, you can use the Stylesheet Compiler to update the class 
names in your CSS and to update the class names in your HTML.

Also it is an unique way to protect your stylesheets from theft. 
Actually, it surly doesn't protects sheets from stealing, 
because it's not really possible in the web technology.

So how it works?
----------------

This software will transform your stylesheets in a way, 
no one will want to modify them. They can steal it, 
but who wants to use (and adjust) stylesheet, 
which looks like if it's made of the worst coder in the universe?
